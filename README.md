This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow. 
My name is Abby Lyons. I am a senior studying Business Analytics at the University of Notre Dame. I am on the lacrosse team so I spend most of my time in team workouts, studying or reading. I am from Long Island, New York but I love spending time in Lake George in the Addirondack Mountains.
